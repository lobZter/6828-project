Changes for adding mac address in envid:
env.c - alloc_env
removed generationid, set envid = (e-envs), this leaves us with 21 bits for the mac address (we can't use the highest bit), but we only use 20 (11th thru 29th).

Mapping envid accross distributed CPUs:
If a CPU receives an envid that is not available, it is mapped to an unused local envid. This mapping is maintained in a fixed-size array (this limits the number of tasks that can be shared, but we will make this number configurable).

Changes for env struct:
- New state ENV_LEASED
- IP of host env_hostip
- bool true if env is alien env_alien

Protocol:
1. Lease Request:
   Request:
	a) env_id
	b) Env struct
   Response:
	No: Retry/Abort
   	Yes: Receiver has already set up mapping & allocated Env struct. Host needs to get ready to send environment physical pages.

2. Send Page Request:
   Request:
	a) env_id
      	b) va
      	c) perm
      	d) chunk id (x/4)
      	e) data for that chunk
   Response:
	Yes: Send next chunk/page
      	No: Retry/Abort

3. Done Request:
   Request:
	a) env_id
   Response:
	Yes: Destroy env_id environment. Environment doesn't "return" anything. Only way to communicate information back to parent is via IPC calls.
	No: Retry/Abort

4. Abort Request:
   Request:
	a) env_id
   Response:
	Yes.

Protocol grammar:

Req 1 Buffer
0, envid_t, struct Env

Req 2 Buffer
1, envid_t, uintptr_t va, int perm, char chunk_id, char[1024] chunk_data

Req 3 Buffer
2, envid_t

Req 4 Buffer
3, envid_t

Response
int status, envid_t envid
